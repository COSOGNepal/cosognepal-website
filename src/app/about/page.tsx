                "Cosog Nepal's journey was rooted in a transformative observation by Bibek, our past president, during his tenure as a STEM instructor. The recent expansion of the Nepalese high school system from 11th-12th to 9th-12th grades opened new doors for younger students, yet many remained unaware of these burgeoning opportunities, especially in technology. Bibek identified a critical void in high schools: the absence of a Computer Science club culture from grade 9 onwards. This gap deprived students of valuable experiences like engaging with cutting-edge technologies, participating in hackathons, and competing in Olympiads – opportunities essential for cultivating tech-savvy and competitive individuals.",
                "Recognizing the need to fill this gap, Bibek, alongside Aashish and five high school graduates, founded Cosog Nepal. Their vision was to establish a culture of technology exploration and innovation in high schools, starting from the 9th grade opening doors to skill refinement, competitive participation, and overall personal and professional growth in the digital age.",
